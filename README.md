# 🐳 hello there

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles, use at your own risk.

All Dockerfiles can be pulled from my private registry `r.unkn.co`

## Aliases

The following images are designed to be used as terminal aliases, allowing developers to run commands like `composer`, `pod`, etc inside of Docker containers. This ensures developers can run the same toolset versions without managing the underlying environment with tools like `nvm`, `rvm`, etc.

- [php/composer](./tree/master/php/composer)
- [ruby/cocoapods](./tree/master/ruby/cocoapods)
